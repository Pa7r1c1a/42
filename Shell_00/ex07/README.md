Step 1
Download resources

Step 2
I created a "work" folder where I copied the resources

Step 3
In the terminal I went into to the "work" folder.

In the terminal type the following command to create the b file from the sw.diff resource file:

patch a -o b < sw.diff

sw.diff serves as a reference to create the b file
-o (output file) creates the b file

Step 4
Copy the b file in your Shell00/ex07 folder. 
It is the only file you have to turn in for this exercice.
Maybe delete or move "resources" and "work" elsewhere before git push ;)

Cheers !
